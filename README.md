# JDX Python

jdx-python is a Python wrapper around libjdx, the low-level C library that manages JDX files directly. It can be used in Python projects (particularly those involving machine learning) to simplify your storage of classified images alongside using the [JDX Command Line Tool](https://github.com/jeffreycshelton/jdx-clt) to create and manage JDX files from the terminal.

## Usage

jdx-python is not yet listed on [PyPi](pypi.org), so it can't be directly installed using `pip install`. However, it will be listed there as soon as it's ready for release. You can install jdx-python directly onto your machine by cloning this repository, navigating to its directory, and typing in your terminal:

`$ python3 setup.py install`
